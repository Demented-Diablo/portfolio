            Hello World, (originality stonks)  <br>
            My name is Gavin Sharma and this is my ever-changing and ever-growing portfolio.<br>

          <p id="childhood">
            As a kid, I was always drawn to technology. I vividly remember the excitement of<br>
            encountering my first smartphone at the age of nine when my dad brought it home.<br>
            The sheer variety of games and applications captivated me instantly.<br>
            Curiosity sparked within me as I began to inquire: How are these games created?<br>
            What makes this device so fascinating? Why hadn't we seen something like this before?<br>
            Although I hadn't pondered it deeply at the time, my fascination with technology grew exponentially,<br>
            igniting a passion that would shape my future.
          </p>

          <p id="decision">
            Throughout my school years, discussions about career paths were distant whispers until the looming<br>
            reality of graduation approached. It was during my 11th grade that I was introduced to Python.<br>
            Memories of my childhood dreams and the allure of the coding world flooded back, reminding me of the<br>
            boundless possibilities that lay within the realm of software development.<br>
            It was then that I realized what I wanted to pursue in life:<br>
            the opportunity to build extraordinary creations that could impact lives and inspire innovation.
          </p>

          <p id="beginning">
            With newfound clarity, I embarked on my journey towards fulfilling my dreams. I enrolled<br>
            at Dalhousie University in Canada, eager to immerse myself in the world of computer science<br>
            and transform my aspirations into reality. Each day is a step closer to realizing my goal<br>
            of creating innovative solutions and contributing to the ever-evolving landscape of technology.

            I was introduced to computer science in my highschool at Lawrence Public School<br>
            Now,  I am pursuing Bachelors of Applied Computer science from Dalhousie University <br>
            where I have been immersing myself in a wide range of comp sci courses. From foundational concepts<br>
            to practical applications, I've been building a strong foundation in programming languages<br>
            like Java, Python, Html, CSS, and JavaScript.
