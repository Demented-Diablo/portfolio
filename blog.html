                    Entering a university can be either be exciting or overwhelming. 
                    You might think that the only difference between a university and a school
                    is the level of education. That kind of thinking can become the catalyst in
                    converting the feeling of excitement to overwhelming anxiety. Here are some major
                    changes you might face, so that you can be prepared for the university life

                <h4>The struggle after the independence</h4>
                <p> When you move to a new city/country for higher studies, there is an obvious
                    excitement that you are finally independent.  That's right, No-one is going to tell
                    you what to do. You can do anything you want. <b>but is that really a good thing?</b>
                    If you look at the bigger picture, yes. It teaches you to be responsible, It allows you to
                    actually make decisions that matters. You can either watch an anime or complete the quiz that is due tonight.
                    It's up to you, how, when, and if you want to learn. The faster you realise this the better it is going to be.

                <h4>Time Management</h4>
                <p>
                    Time management plays a vital role in the life of a University Student.  Unlike schools, universities don't have classes
                    under a set period of time.Your classes can either be compressed into a 3-day extemely hectic schedule
                    or a relaxing 1-2 class 5-days a week schedule. It's up to you to decide what works the best for you. You also have the 
                    liberty to decide if you want to take classes in the morning, afternoon and evening. Mnay Students make the mistake
                    of taking morning classes even though they are not a morning person, what follows is a series of coming late to class
                    and sometimes even missing the class which affects their schedule. Time Management affects a students daily life in many ways.
                    If you practice proper Time Management, you can really enjoy your university life. You can party, have fun with friends and 
                    still complete your assignments on time.

                <h4>Professors vs Teachers</h4>
                <p>
                    In schools, your teachers know you personally and know if you are struggling somewhere,
                    whereas in university a professor has hundreds of students to teach and they won't necessarily
                    know your name. You can get one-on-one time with your teacher in class but to meet a professor
                    you will have to book an appointment or visit them during office hours. So, to succed in university
                    life, you need to develop an habit of asking for help or advice from your professors if needed

                <h4>Some tools I personally use to succeed in University</h4>
                <p>
                    I use <a href="https://www.notion.so/product" target="_blank" >Notion</a> to create notes during and after the lecture.
                    I create all sorts of time-tables using <a href="https://g.co/kgs/WRLXctj" target="_blank" >Google Sheets.</a>
                    My university's <a href="https://util.library.dal.ca/calculator/" target="_blank" >assignment calculator</a> has saved a lot my time.
